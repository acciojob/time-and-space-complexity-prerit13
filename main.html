  <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

  <p>
    Time complexity is a way to represent how the running time of an algorithm increases with the input size. Algorithms with lower time complexity are more efficient and preferred in most scenarios.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. For example, an algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) uses memory that grows linearly with the input size.
